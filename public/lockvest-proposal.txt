LockVest — Embedded RWA Marketplace on Pharos
“Tokenize Trust. Unlock Property Wealth.”

Executive Summary
Pharos’s Innovation Proposal (PIP) aims to catalyze a vibrant RWAfi (Real-World Asset finance) ecosystem. We propose to build LockVest, an embedded RWA marketplace widget on the Pharos blockchain, designed to democratize access to tangible investments. LockVest leverages Pharos’s ultra-fast, EVM-compatible Layer-1 (50,000 TPS) to enable the seamless tokenization and fractionalization of real-world assets, such as real estate, commodities, and infrastructure-linked products. By embedding the marketplace as a lightweight widget, LockVest empowers developers, platforms, and communities to integrate RWA access directly within their ecosystems, lowering entry barriers for global users. This project aligns with Pharos’s mission of unlocking new liquidity and bridging real-world markets with decentralized finance. By bringing fractionalized assets on-chain, LockVest opens up transparent, borderless, and efficient investment opportunities for individuals and institutions worldwide, strengthening the global RWAfi ecosystem.
Background & Market Opportunity
Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization is a fast-growing sector: the crypto market for RWAs already exceeds $230 billion, largely driven by fiat-backed stablecoins. Tokenization removes traditional barriers by converting physical assets such as real estate, bonds, and commodities into blockchain tokens. This enables fractional ownership, borderless transferability, and instant global trading. For example, tokenized real estate can divide ownership into tradable units at minimal cost, unlocking high-value markets for a broader base of investors.
Despite the ~$300 trillion global asset pool, only about $25 trillion is currently liquid. Tokenization has the potential to expand this liquidity dramatically, enhancing capital efficiency while creating new on-chain investment opportunities. As governments, enterprises, and financial institutions explore tokenized real estate, commodities, and debt instruments, the demand for transparent, compliant, and high-performance marketplaces continues to grow. Our marketplace directly addresses this global opportunity by providing a secure, scalable, and accessible platform where individuals and institutions can participate in tokenized asset markets, thereby contributing to the broader adoption of RWA finance.
Summary of Problem Statement
Illiquid markets: About $300 Trillion global real estate, but >90% locked in high-value, hard-to-access assets.


Trust gap: Fraud and opaque title records erode investor confidence.


Exclusion: Traditional real estate investments frequently require substantial capital syndications which often demand $25,000 to $100,000, while some crowdfunding platforms enable access with just $10 to $500.
Proposed Solution (LockVest)
We will develop a widget-based RWA marketplace as highlighted by Pharos. Users can integrate our marketplace into existing applications or websites, enabling seamless listing, buying, and selling of tokenized assets. Key features include:
Non-Custodial Trading: Investors interact directly with smart contracts that handle escrow and settlement - no intermediaries, no extra fees.


Live Oracle Feeds: Chainlink (or equivalent) oracles supply real-time asset data—market valuations, title status, and compliance checks—so users always transact with verified information.


Multi-Asset Support: Beyond property shares (ERC-20), LockVest accommodates NFTs (ERC-721) for unique titles, commodity tokens, and compliant stablecoins, reflecting the diversity of the global economy.


Seamless User Experience: A simple, secure UI will let users browse assets, view provenance (on-chain records), and execute trades. Our front-end engineers will implement intuitive navigation and localization (multi-language support) for broader adoption.
Enterprise-Grade Performance: Underpinned by Pharos’s modular, parallel architecture, all interactions achieve sub-second finality at up to 50 000 TPS—enabling high-volume marketplaces without lag.
Security & Open-Source Transparency: 
Rigorous third-party audits (e.g., Hacken) and continuous QA.
SPN-powered zero-knowledge compliance proofs on-chain.
All smart contracts and SDK released under MIT license to foster community trust and extensibility.
Pharos Advantages and Alignment
Building on Pharos provides strategic benefits. Its 50,000 TPS capability supports the high transaction rates needed for real-time asset trading. Pharos also offers Specialized Processing Nodes (SPNs) and a dual-VM architecture, ensuring both EVM compatibility and high performance. The PIP program highlights RWAfi and DeFi as focus areas; our marketplace directly matches this vision. Pharos’s support package (developer office hours, marketing assistance, institutional introductions) will further accelerate our project.
By aligning with Pharos’s program timeline and priorities, we maximize our chance of success. We will take full advantage of Pharos’s Pharos Innovation Proposal (PIP) ecosystem, tapping its funding pool and mentorship to refine our approach.
